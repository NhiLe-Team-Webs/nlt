Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces. Implement real working code with exceptional aesthetic attention.

## Workflow Selection

Choose workflow based on input type:

| Input | Workflow | Reference |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Screenshot | Replicate exactly | `./resources/workflow-screenshot.md` |
| Video | Replicate with animations | `./resources/workflow-video.md` |
| Screenshot/Video (describe only) | Document for devs | `./resources/workflow-describe.md` |
| 3D/WebGL request | Three.js immersive | `./resources/workflow-3d.md` |
| Quick task | Rapid implementation | `./resources/workflow-quick.md` |
| Complex/award-quality | Full immersive | `./resources/workflow-immersive.md` |
| From scratch | Design Thinking below | - |

**All workflows**: Activate `skill-ui-ux-pro-max` skill FIRST for design intelligence.

## Screenshot/Video Replication (Quick Reference)

1. **Analyze** with `skill-ai-multimodal` skill - extract colors, fonts, spacing, effects
2. **Plan** with `.agent/agents/agent-ui-ux-designer/agent-ui-ux-designer.md` instructions - create phased implementation
3. **Implement** - match source precisely
4. **Verify** - compare to original
5. **Document** - update `./docs/design-guidelines.md` if approved

See specific workflow files for detailed steps.

## Design Thinking (From Scratch)

Before coding, commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Execute with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - intentionality is key.

## Aesthetics Guidelines

- **Typography**: Avoid Arial/Inter; use distinctive, characterful fonts. Pair display + body fonts.
- **Color**: Commit to cohesive palette. CSS variables. Dominant colors with sharp accents.
- **Motion**: CSS-first, anime.js for complex (`./resources/animejs.md`). Orchestrated page loads > scattered micro-interactions.
- **Spatial**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds**: Atmosphere over solid colors. Gradients, noise, patterns, shadows, grain.
- **Assets**: Generate with `skill-ai-multimodal`, process with `skill-media-processing`

## Asset & Analysis References

| Task | Reference |
|------|-----------|
| Generate assets | `./resources/asset-generation.md` |
| Analyze quality | `./resources/visual-analysis-overview.md` |
| Extract guidelines | `./resources/design-extraction-overview.md` |
| Optimization | `./resources/technical-overview.md` |
| Animations | `./resources/animejs.md` |

Quick start: `./resources/ai-multimodal-overview.md`

## Anti-Patterns (AI Slop)

NEVER use:
- Overused fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Space Grotesk
- Cliched colors: purple gradients on white
- Predictable layouts, cookie-cutter patterns

DO:
- Vary themes (light/dark), fonts, aesthetics per project
- Match complexity to vision (maximalist = elaborate; minimalist = precise)
- Make unexpected, context-specific choices

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Commit fully to distinctive visions.
